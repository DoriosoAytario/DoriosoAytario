- currently trying to work on my first true solo videogame (its going... nowhere)
- id love to find someone to teach me more about coding, self teaching can only go so far (at least ai helps... ;-;)
- i have boundless ideas for enless projects, feel free to ask me if you're bored and have nothing better to do, i can give you a mountain of work lol (for free cuz im broke tho)
- i'm mainly active on discord "dorioso_aytario" but i get a lot of dms, so dont forget to say why you're here (i'll always reply to dm, and im chronically online)
-  Pronouns: uhh what even is gender ? use any, i dont really care (born male for those who care)
-  Fun fact: i used to be an mma fighter, now i just have paranoia and violent reflexes (and fight cravings)
